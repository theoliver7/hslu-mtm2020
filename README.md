# Master the Mainframe 2020
Code for the Master the Mainframe challenge. The aim of the challenge was to get to know and use mainframe technologies. These technologies include Zowe CLI, Z Open Automation Utilities, Ansible, REXX, JCL, COBOL,


## Grand Challenge
"Come up with your own great idea: Ideas come in all shapes and sizes. We want you to think of
something you can build, using the mainframe technology available to you.
It should be something that makes mainframers go “Wow, I want THAT on my systems!”. It needs to
involve the mainframe and be demonstratable using the system that we’ve made available for these
challenges."

In the Grand Challenge of the competition I integrated swiss public transport information into the coding workflow.
